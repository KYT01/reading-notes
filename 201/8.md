## CSS layout

- Flex items move as a group on the main axis. The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if flex-direction is row the cross axis runs along the column. You can move the items individually or as a group, so they align against each other and the flex container. Also, if you have wrapped flex lines, you can treat those lines as a group to control how space is assigned to those lines.

- You should be cautious when using any properties that reorder the visual display away from how things are ordered in the HTML document, as it can negatively impact accessibility. The row-reverse and column-reverse values are a good example of this. The reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order. This is important to understand as the logical order is the order that a screen reader will read out the content, and anyone navigating using the keyboard will follow.

- The following simple layout designs are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools in any kind of convenient, flexible way:

Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.

Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.


- I belive this topic is very important for my long term goals as I would like to go into UX UI design or a similar area. Learning more about layout in CSS would be very helpful to me as a designer.
