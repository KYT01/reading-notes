### State and Props

- The render would happen before the componentDidMount.
- The first thing to happen in react is Mounting. Mounting is when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during mounting.

- In order that they happen:
- constructor
- render
- react updates
- componentDidMount
- componentWillUnmount

- componentDidMount()
- This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, donâ€™t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().

#### state vs prop

- PROPS:
- you can pass things like the inital count of a counter application.
- props are used for things you would want to pass like a function.
- They are what you want your component to render like.
- we re-render our application when things like titles are changed.
- Somthing that could be stored in a state could be the current count for a counter application.

- For a counter application, the inital count would be done as a prop but current count would be stored in the state.
