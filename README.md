#### Growth Mindset

> A growth mindset is a belief that through enough practice and work, you will be able to not only improve your own skills but also learn new ones.

- Try and learn something new every week.
- Practice coding outside of learning hours.
- Look at how I can apply coding to my creative workflow.
