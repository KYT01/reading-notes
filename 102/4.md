## 04 Notes

- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used for creating and structuring the content of web pages. HTML uses tags to define the elements and structure of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.
We use HTML to create the structure and layout of web pages. It provides a standardized way to define the different parts of a webpage and their relationships. HTML enables us to format and organize text, embed media, create links, and add interactivity through forms and other elements.

- The three main parts of an HTML element are the opening tag, the content, and the closing tag.
Opening tag: This is the starting part of an HTML element and is denoted by the < symbol followed by the element's name.
Content: The content refers to the information or text contained within the HTML element.
Closing tag: This is the ending part of an HTML element and is denoted by the </ symbol followed by the element's name enclosed in angle brackets (>).

- When you give an element extra information, it is called providing attributes.
Attributes are additional pieces of information that can be added to HTML elements. They provide extra details or instructions about the element, such as its behavior, appearance, or functionality. Attributes are specified within the opening tag of an HTML element and consist of a name-value pair.
For example, in the following HTML <a> (anchor) element, the href attribute provides the destination URL for the link:

- A semantic element is an HTML tag that carries meaning or represents specific types of content on a web page. It provides a descriptive and meaningful way to structure and present the content.
For example, using the <header> tag to mark the introductory section of a webpage or using the <nav> tag to define the navigation menu.
