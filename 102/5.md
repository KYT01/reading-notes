## 05 Notes

- The purpose of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is to define the presentation and visual styling of a web page. It is used to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of HTML elements on a website. CSS separates the content of a web page from its presentation, allowing developers to easily update the design and style of multiple pages simultaneously by modifying a single CSS file.

- The three ways to insert CSS into a project are:

Inline CSS: This involves directly adding the CSS rules within the HTML elements using the "style" attribute. For example: <p style="color: blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>
Internal CSS: This method involves placing CSS code within the <style> tags in the head section of an HTML document. The CSS rules will apply to the entire document.
External CSS: This approach involves creating a separate CSS file with a .css extension and linking it to the HTML document using the <link> tag. The CSS rules defined in the external file will apply to the HTML elements referenced in the document.

- The CSS rule that would give all <p> elements red text is:
p {
    color: red;
}
