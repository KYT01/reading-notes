- Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.
- In Git, cloning refers to the process of creating a local copy of a remote repository. When you clone a repository, you retrieve all the files, history, branches, and metadata associated with the remote repository and create a duplicate copy on your local machine. This local copy is a complete repository that allows you to work with the files and contribute to the project.
- To clone a Git repository, you typically use the git clone command followed by the URL of the remote repository.
- Track files: To start tracking a new file or to track changes made to an existing file, you can use the git add command followed by the file or directory name.
- Stage changes: Once you have added or modified files, you need to stage them for committing. Staging is the process of preparing files to be included in the next commit. To stage the changes, you can use the git add command.
- To take a snapshot of your changed files in Git, you need to create a commit. A commit represents a specific version of your project with a unique identifier and contains the changes you have staged. The command to create a commit is 'git commit'.
Commit your changes: Before pushing your changes to GitHub, you must create a commit with your desired changes using the 'git commit'
- you can push your committed changes to GitHub using the 'git push' command. This command uploads your local commits to the remote repository.
