## 06 Notes

- Variables in JavaScript are used to store and manipulate data. They act as containers for storing values, such as numbers, strings or booleans. Variables provide a way to reference and access data throughout a JavaScript program. They can be declared using the var, let, or const keywords and can be assigned values, which can be changed or updated during the execution of the program.

- To declare a variable means to create it and specify its name. When you declare a variable in a programming language like JavaScript, you are essentially introducing a new identifier or symbol that can be used to store and reference values or data. 

- An assignment operator in programming, such as the "=" operator in JavaScript, is used to assign a value to a variable. It assigns the value on the right-hand side of the operator to the variable on the left-hand side. In other words, it stores or updates a value in a variable. For example, in the statement x = 5;, the assignment operator "=" assigns the value 5 to the variable "x". 

- Information received from the user is typically referred to as "input". It represents data or values provided by the user to a program or system. This input can come from various sources such as keyboard input, mouse interaction, or other input devices.
